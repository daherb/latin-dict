Source: http://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/dictpage.zip

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whitaker's_Words

Usage:

  cat DICTPAGE.RAW | perl convert.pl

Output:

  DictLatAbs.gf
  DictLat.gf

Uses Herbert Lange's RGL implementation of Latin. The Latin part of the RGL has to be available
in the './latin' subdirectory for the Makefile to work. You can use 'ln -s PATH_TO_RGL/src/latin'
to create it.

Coverage: 37850 lemmas out of 39225 entries. Missing are 227 and ignored in the converion
are 23
Reasons for uncovered entries
- uncommon category (e.g. structural words)
- numerals
- single word forms that are also included in other paradigms
- missing information and word forms
